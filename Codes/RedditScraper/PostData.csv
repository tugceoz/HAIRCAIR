I added an album of pics, some of them are me when I was younger but I am 27 now, just moved to a pretty fashionable city called Seattle and am involved in the acting community.  I was just wondering what the good folks of this sub can recommend as far as a good attractive looking hairstyle for me.  I have done the high school musical/bieber emo look, and the undercut quiff style.  I would like opinions on what looks most attractive on my face.  I can grow facial hair if needed, but I have always rocked the pretty boy emo look.  I do think the undercut style (short on sides and long on top) looks good, because of compliments from people on the top photo in the album especially.  I just want to know for sure what to rock and what will compliment my looks best.

Over the years, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the hair care advice I've come across. Things never seem to work the way they're supposed to, and people seem to exclusively rely on anecdotes and personal experiences when giving their recommendations, often repeating things they read in a beauty mag or blog where the main goal is often to sell hair product or push dogma.

So I've done some digging, to learn a little bit about the real chemistry and science behind your hair care products, to dispel some myths and get to the truth of what's going on with your hair.

# What is hair?

>*Hair is an integrated system with a peculiar chemical and physical behavior. It is a complex structure of several morphological components that act as a unit. The hair shaft of mammals is divided into three main regions: Cuticle, cortex and medulla. The medulla is present in corser hair like grey hair, thick hair and beard hair, and it is absent in fine hair of children. There is more medulla in the coarser hair of Asians than Caucasians. The medulla may be involved in the splitting of hairs since it provides an area of weakness as a pathway for the propagation of cracks along the axis of the fiber.*  
*The cuticle is a chemically resistant region and consists of flap overlapping scales (keratinocytes) like shingles on the roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible for the differential friction effect in hair. The cuticle is generally formed by 6–8 scales thick for Asians, slightly less in Caucasians and even less in African hair. A thinner cuticle layer makes African hair more prone to breakage.*

# Why do we shampoo? Is it necessary?

Over time, your hair will develop a build up of dirt and other pollutants (eg: campfire smoke, minerals from hard water) as well as sebum, sweat and dead/peeled skin.

Prior to the 1930's we simply used bar soap to wash our hair. The issue with this is that it would often leave a residue/soap scum on the scalp and hair, which is uncomfortable and aesthetically unpleasing. Shampoo was the answer.

In recent years, you may have heard that you don't need to shampoo, and that it causes your hair to produce more oils. This is untrue- there is no evidence to support the claim that using shampoo stimulates production of sebum on the scalp, including shampoos that contain sulfates and silicons.

Most proponents of no-poo substitute shampoo with an alternative such as ACV or a specially formulated conditioner that effectively serves the same purpose.

# How does shampoo work?

The main active ingredient in shampoo is a type of molecule called a surfacant. This is typically a sulfate, with the most common being Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. You may have heard that all sulfates do is ""create suds"" and damage your hair, this is incorrect.

>*Residues are nonsoluble fats (sebum) that do not dissolve with water. In order to be removed from the hair shaft, surfactants present a hydrophobic molecular portion, and another hydrophilic. The former will chemically bond with the fat, while the latter will bond with the water. The surfactants are generally composed of a chain of fatty hydrocarbons (tail) and a polar head. The polar extremity is capable of giving this portion of the molecule hydrophilic traits that allow it to dissolve in water and wash away the residues.*

What this basically means is that one end of the surfacant will attract water, and the other will repel it and attract sebum, allowing it to be washed out of the hair along with the shampoo.

Surfacants can be classified into four groups: Anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic.

[Here's a classifications chart of common surfacants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/bin/IJT-7-2-g001.jpg)

* **Anionic detergents:** Among the most popular surfactants, they are named for their negatively charged hydrophilic polar group. Derived from fatty alcohols, they are very good at removing sebum from the scalp and hair. However, the excessively cleaned hair is harsh, rough, dull with frizz and prone to tangling. Among them, different classes of detergents are available with certain selective properties.  


1. **Lauryl sulfates:** Popular primary cleansers, they work well in both hard and soft water, produce rich foam, and are easily rinsed. They are excellent cleansers, commonly used in shampoos for oily hair. As the hair becomes harsh and rough, careful selection of a secondary detergent and possible use of a conditioning agent is always required as part of the shampoo formulation. Examples of this class include: Sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and ammonium lauryl sulfate
2. **Laureth sulfates:** These are another class of excellent detergents with good cleansing ability and foaming property which are useful for normal-to-dry hair. Examples of this chemical class are: Sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate
3. **Sarcosines:** They are generally secondary detergents, as they do not remove sebum well from the hair to justify as primary cleansers. They are listed as the second or third on ingredient list of detergents. Excellent conditioners are used in conditioning shampoos and dry hair shampoos. Examples are: Lauryl sarcosine and sodium lauryl sarcosinate
4. **Sulfosuccinates:** These are strong detergents commonly used as a secondary surfactant in oily hair shampoos. Examples are disodium oleaminesulfosuccinate and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.

* **Cationic Detergents:** In contrast to anionic detergents they have a positively charged polar group. They are poor cleansers and do not lather well and are not compatible with anionic detergents, limiting their utility. However, they are excellent at imparting softness and manageability to chemically damaged hair and so are primarily used as daily shampoo for damaged hair such as in case of permanently dyed or chemically bleached hair. Examples are: Long-chain amino esters, ammonioesters, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.
* **Amphoteric Detergents:** Having both positively and negatively charged polar group, they behave differently at lower pH (as cationic detergent) and at higher pH (as anionic detergent). Subgroups include the betaines, sultaines, and imidazolinium derivatives. They are used in baby shampoo and for those with fine and damaged hair because they don’t cause stinging in the eyes in children, foam well and leave hair in manageable state. Examples are: Cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauraminopropionate.
* **Nonionic Detergents:** They have no polar group and are among the mildest of all cleansers and aid to improve the antistatic qualities of a shampoo. They can be combined with ionic detergent as a secondary cleanser. Examples are: Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters and alkanolamides.

All shampoos contain some variation or combination of these substances to wash your hair. Some sulfate-free shampoos may contain none, but this means that they are basically not effectively cleansing your hair. (most sulfate free shampoos will simply use a surfacant that doesn't contain the word ""sulfate"", though)

High end shampoos from salons contain these same ingredients, with the main difference being perhaps nicer smells and a much stronger concentration that requires dilution in water before use.

##### How often should I shampoo?

You probably do not need to shampoo every day, and you do not need to go weeks without shampooing. Shampoo your hair when it is oily or dirty. Experiment with different shampoos and take a look at the active chemicals that are doing the heavy lifting.

# The benefit of conditioner

Modern shampoos are extremely effective. Unfortunately, heavily cleansed hair is not desirable to most, as it is harsh, hard to manage, prone to tangling, and looks dull.

The solution to this is a conditioner, which are sometimes included in the shampoo itself.

A conditioner is any substance which is intended to enhance feel, appearance, fullness, lubricity, shine, and general manageability of hair.

>*Conditioner molecules contain cationic surfactant which gives a positive electric charge to the conditioner. The negative charge of the hair is attracted to the positively charged conditioner molecules, which results in conditioner getting deposited on the hair, especially on areas where there is degree of weathering. This is true for damaged hair as they are even more negatively charged. Thus, conditioners reduce the static electricity. They also flatten the cuticle scales over the hair shaft, reducing the friction between hair fibers, increasing the reflectance of light which improves shine and color. The smooth feel resulting from conditioner use gives easier combing and detangling in both wet and dry conditions. Conditioners temporarily seal split ends and mend trichoptilosis.*

Conditioners will contain a wide variety of ingredients:

* **Cationic surfactants:** Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behentrimonium or propyltrimonium, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine. They are considered the backbone of a conditioner Polymers: Mono and polypeptides like hydrolyzed proteins (amino acids), polypeptides derived from collagen and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
* **Bodying agents and thickeners:** Fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), waxes (e.g. carnauba wax and paraffin wax), or gums (e.g. guar gum) and salt (sodium chloride)
* **Emollients/oily compounds:** These include natural or synthetic oils, but also esters and waxes. Natural oils used in conditioners are, for example, jojoba oil, olive oil, or grape seed oil. The most frequently used synthetic oils are silicone (e.g. dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicone and cyclomethicone) which are even superior to natural oils in terms of film formation, shine and luster. Asian countries have large hair diameters, therefore a higher concentration of silicone is used as compared to that for Caucasian hair (3-5% vs 0.5%)\[1\]
* **Auxiliary emulsifiers:** Ethoxylated fatty alcohols (e.g. polysorbate-80 or ceteareth-20) which are non-ionic agents seem to be particularly effective at providing emulsion stability if it cannot be acheived by catiionic agents alone in a conditioner.

The big bogeyman you may notice is silicons. It is not bad for your hair, and not all silicons are equal. If you use a good shampoo with a good surfacant, build-up is not a concern and you likely don't need to worry too much about this. The backlash against silicons cropped up when people decided to eschew sulfates in their shampoo. Many people quickly realized that without proper cleansing, some silicons would build up in the hair over time.

Like all things related to hair care, the key is balance. A fairly comprehensive resource for different types of silicons and how they behave is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) on [/r/HairCareScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/HairCareScience)\*, keep this in mind when deciding on which hair product to purchase for your hair.

\*while [/r/HairCareScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/HairCareScience) has some good information on it and the moderators know their stuff, be wary of basically every comment from the users, as most of them are simply giving others anecdotal advice and spreading bogeymen.

# How to wash and condition your hair.

The way you apply these products to your hair is undervalued, and doing it properly may have more benefit than you might suspect.

Shampoo should be applied starting from the front and working your way to the back. Applying it directly to the top of the head will create friction and cause tangling.

Once the shampoo has been rinsed from your hair, it's recommended to gently towel dry your hair before applying the conditioner. Conditioner should be applied on the length of the hair, avoiding the scalp.

Leaving conditioner in your hair is not necessary, once the product has been spread over the surface of your hair it has done its job and may be rinsed out completely.

Afterwards the hair may be gently towel dried.

(If your hair is curly, there may be extra steps such as applying a leave-in product while hair is still wet. Using such products on straight thin hair may result in it looking oily and dull.)

# TL;DR?

* Wash your hair when it's dirty/oily.
* There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.
* Sulfates are not bad for your hair, but may cause it to look dry and become hard to manage.
* Use conditioner or use a less effective surfacant to combat the above problem.
* Silicons are not bad for your hair, most good shampoos will prevent any build up from happening.
* The key to good hair care is not going ""no poo"" or ""sulfate/silicon free"", it's finding the right balance of chemicals to wash your hair and keep it looking good.

5045,"Over the years, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the hair care advice I've come across. Things never seem to work the way they're supposed to, and people seem to exclusively rely on anecdotes and personal experiences when giving their recommendations, often repeating things they read in a beauty mag or blog where the main goal is often to sell hair product or push dogma.

So I've done some digging, to learn a little bit about the real chemistry and science behind your hair care products, to dispel some myths and get to the truth of what's going on with your hair.

#What is hair?

>*Hair is an integrated system with a peculiar chemical and physical behavior. It is a complex structure of several morphological components that act as a unit. The hair shaft of mammals is divided into three main regions: Cuticle, cortex and medulla. The medulla is present in corser hair like grey hair, thick hair and beard hair, and it is absent in fine hair of children. There is more medulla in the coarser hair of Asians than Caucasians. The medulla may be involved in the splitting of hairs since it provides an area of weakness as a pathway for the propagation of cracks along the axis of the fiber.*

>*The cuticle is a chemically resistant region and consists of flap overlapping scales (keratinocytes) like shingles on the roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible for the differential friction effect in hair. The cuticle is generally formed by 6–8 scales thick for Asians, slightly less in Caucasians and even less in African hair. A thinner cuticle layer makes African hair more prone to breakage.*

#Why do we shampoo? Is it necessary?

Over time, your hair will develop a build up of dirt and other pollutants (eg: campfire smoke, minerals from hard water) as well as sebum, sweat and dead/peeled skin.

Prior to the 1930's we simply used bar soap to wash our hair. The issue with this is that it would often leave a residue/soap scum on the scalp and hair, which is uncomfortable and aesthetically unpleasing. Shampoo was the answer.

In recent years, you may have heard that you don't need to shampoo, and that it causes your hair to produce more oils. This is untrue- there is no evidence to support the claim that using shampoo stimulates production of sebum on the scalp, including shampoos that contain sulfates and silicons.

Most proponents of no-poo substitute shampoo with an alternative such as ACV or a specially formulated conditioner that effectively serves the same purpose.

#How does shampoo work?

The main active ingredient in shampoo is a type of molecule called a surfacant. This is typically a sulfate, with the most common being Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. You may have heard that all sulfates do is ""create suds"" and damage your hair, this is incorrect.

>*Residues are nonsoluble fats (sebum) that do not dissolve with water. In order to be removed from the hair shaft, surfactants present a hydrophobic molecular portion, and another hydrophilic. The former will chemically bond with the fat, while the latter will bond with the water. The surfactants are generally composed of a chain of fatty hydrocarbons (tail) and a polar head. The polar extremity is capable of giving this portion of the molecule hydrophilic traits that allow it to dissolve in water and wash away the residues.* 

What this basically means is that one end of the surfacant will attract water, and the other will repel it and attract sebum, allowing it to be washed out of the hair along with the shampoo.

Surfacants can be classified into four groups: Anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic.

[Here's a classifications chart of common surfacants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/bin/IJT-7-2-g001.jpg) 

* **Anionic detergents:** Among the most popular surfactants, they are named for their negatively charged hydrophilic polar group. Derived from fatty alcohols, they are very good at removing sebum from the scalp and hair. However, the excessively cleaned hair is harsh, rough, dull with frizz and prone to tangling. Among them, different classes of detergents are available with certain selective properties.
 1. **Lauryl sulfates:** Popular primary cleansers, they work well in both hard and soft water, produce rich foam, and are easily rinsed. They are excellent cleansers, commonly used in shampoos for oily hair. As the hair becomes harsh and rough, careful selection of a secondary detergent and possible use of a conditioning agent is always required as part of the shampoo formulation. Examples of this class include: Sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and ammonium lauryl sulfate
 2. **Laureth sulfates:** These are another class of excellent detergents with good cleansing ability and foaming property which are useful for normal-to-dry hair. Examples of this chemical class are: Sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate
 3. **Sarcosines:** They are generally secondary detergents, as they do not remove sebum well from the hair to justify as primary cleansers. They are listed as the second or third on ingredient list of detergents. Excellent conditioners are used in conditioning shampoos and dry hair shampoos. Examples are: Lauryl sarcosine and sodium lauryl sarcosinate
 4. **Sulfosuccinates:** These are strong detergents commonly used as a secondary surfactant in oily hair shampoos. Examples are disodium oleaminesulfosuccinate and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.

* **Cationic Detergents:** In contrast to anionic detergents they have a positively charged polar group. They are poor cleansers and do not lather well and are not compatible with anionic detergents, limiting their utility. However, they are excellent at imparting softness and manageability to chemically damaged hair and so are primarily used as daily shampoo for damaged hair such as in case of permanently dyed or chemically bleached hair. Examples are: Long-chain amino esters, ammonioesters, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.

* **Amphoteric Detergents:** Having both positively and negatively charged polar group, they behave differently at lower pH (as cationic detergent) and at higher pH (as anionic detergent). Subgroups include the betaines, sultaines, and imidazolinium derivatives. They are used in baby shampoo and for those with fine and damaged hair because they don’t cause stinging in the eyes in children, foam well and leave hair in manageable state. Examples are: Cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauraminopropionate.

* **Nonionic Detergents:** They have no polar group and are among the mildest of all cleansers and aid to improve the antistatic qualities of a shampoo. They can be combined with ionic detergent as a secondary cleanser. Examples are: Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters and alkanolamides.

All shampoos contain some variation or combination of these substances to wash your hair. Some sulfate-free shampoos may contain none, but this means that they are basically not effectively cleansing your hair. (most sulfate free shampoos will simply use a surfacant that doesn't contain the word ""sulfate"", though)

High end shampoos from salons contain these same ingredients, with the main difference being perhaps nicer smells and a much stronger concentration that requires dilution in water before use.

#####How often should I shampoo?

You probably do not need to shampoo every day, and you do not need to go weeks without shampooing. Shampoo your hair when it is oily or dirty. Experiment with different shampoos and take a look at the active chemicals that are doing the heavy lifting. 

#The benefit of conditioner

Modern shampoos are extremely effective. Unfortunately, heavily cleansed hair is not desirable to most, as it is harsh, hard to manage, prone to tangling, and looks dull.

The solution to this is a conditioner, which are sometimes included in the shampoo itself. 

A conditioner is any substance which is intended to enhance feel, appearance, fullness, lubricity, shine, and general manageability of hair. 

>*Conditioner molecules contain cationic surfactant which gives a positive electric charge to the conditioner. The negative charge of the hair is attracted to the positively charged conditioner molecules, which results in conditioner getting deposited on the hair, especially on areas where there is degree of weathering. This is true for damaged hair as they are even more negatively charged. Thus, conditioners reduce the static electricity. They also flatten the cuticle scales over the hair shaft, reducing the friction between hair fibers, increasing the reflectance of light which improves shine and color. The smooth feel resulting from conditioner use gives easier combing and detangling in both wet and dry conditions. Conditioners temporarily seal split ends and mend trichoptilosis.*

Conditioners will contain a wide variety of ingredients:

* **Cationic surfactants:** Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behentrimonium or propyltrimonium, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine. They are considered the backbone of a conditioner
Polymers: Mono and polypeptides like hydrolyzed proteins (amino acids), polypeptides derived from collagen and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)

* **Bodying agents and thickeners:** Fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), waxes (e.g. carnauba wax and paraffin wax), or gums (e.g. guar gum) and salt (sodium chloride)

* **Emollients/oily compounds:** These include natural or synthetic oils, but also esters and waxes. Natural oils used in conditioners are, for example, jojoba oil, olive oil, or grape seed oil. The most frequently used synthetic oils are silicone (e.g. dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicone and cyclomethicone) which are even superior to natural oils in terms of film formation, shine and luster. Asian countries have large hair diameters, therefore a higher concentration of silicone is used as compared to that for Caucasian hair (3-5% vs 0.5%)[1]

* **Auxiliary emulsifiers:** Ethoxylated fatty alcohols (e.g. polysorbate-80 or ceteareth-20) which are non-ionic agents seem to be particularly effective at providing emulsion stability if it cannot be acheived by catiionic agents alone in a conditioner.

The big bogeyman you may notice is silicons. It is not bad for your hair, and not all silicons are equal. If you use a good shampoo with a good surfacant, build-up is not a concern and you likely don't need to worry too much about this. The backlash against silicons cropped up when people decided to eschew sulfates in their shampoo. Many people quickly realized that without proper cleansing, some silicons would build up in the hair over time.

Like all things related to hair care, the key is balance. A fairly comprehensive resource for different types of silicons and how they behave is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) on /r/HairCareScience*, keep this in mind when deciding on which hair product to purchase for your hair.

*while /r/HairCareScience has some good information on it and the moderators know their stuff, be wary of basically every comment from the users, as most of them are simply giving others anecdotal advice and spreading bogeymen.

#How to wash and condition your hair.

The way you apply these products to your hair is undervalued, and doing it properly may have more benefit than you might suspect.

Shampoo should be applied starting from the front and working your way to the back. Applying it directly to the top of the head will create friction and cause tangling. 

Once the shampoo has been rinsed from your hair, it's recommended to gently towel dry your hair before applying the conditioner. Conditioner should be applied on the length of the hair, avoiding the scalp.

Leaving conditioner in your hair is not necessary, once the product has been spread over the surface of your hair it has done its job and may be rinsed out completely.

Afterwards the hair may be gently towel dried. 

(If your hair is curly, there may be extra steps such as applying a leave-in product while hair is still wet. Using such products on straight thin hair may result in it looking oily and dull.)

#TL;DR?

* Wash your hair when it's dirty/oily. 

* There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.

* Sulfates are not bad for your hair, but may cause it to look dry and become hard to manage. 

* Use conditioner or use a less effective surfacant to combat the above problem.

* Silicons are not bad for your hair, most good shampoos will prevent any build up from happening.

* The key to good hair care is not going ""no poo"" or ""sulfate/silicon free"", it's finding the right balance of chemicals to wash your hair and keep it looking good.

Over the years, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the hair care advice I've come across. Things never seem to work the way they're supposed to, and people seem to exclusively rely on anecdotes and personal experiences when giving their recommendations, often repeating things they read in a beauty mag or blog where the main goal is often to sell hair product or push dogma.

So I've done some digging, to learn a little bit about the real chemistry and science behind your hair care products, to dispel some myths and get to the truth of what's going on with your hair.

# What is hair?

>*Hair is an integrated system with a peculiar chemical and physical behavior. It is a complex structure of several morphological components that act as a unit. The hair shaft of mammals is divided into three main regions: Cuticle, cortex and medulla. The medulla is present in corser hair like grey hair, thick hair and beard hair, and it is absent in fine hair of children. There is more medulla in the coarser hair of Asians than Caucasians. The medulla may be involved in the splitting of hairs since it provides an area of weakness as a pathway for the propagation of cracks along the axis of the fiber.*  
*The cuticle is a chemically resistant region and consists of flap overlapping scales (keratinocytes) like shingles on the roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible for the differential friction effect in hair. The cuticle is generally formed by 6–8 scales thick for Asians, slightly less in Caucasians and even less in African hair. A thinner cuticle layer makes African hair more prone to breakage.*

# Why do we shampoo? Is it necessary?

Over time, your hair will develop a build up of dirt and other pollutants (eg: campfire smoke, minerals from hard water) as well as sebum, sweat and dead/peeled skin.

Prior to the 1930's we simply used bar soap to wash our hair. The issue with this is that it would often leave a residue/soap scum on the scalp and hair, which is uncomfortable and aesthetically unpleasing. Shampoo was the answer.

In recent years, you may have heard that you don't need to shampoo, and that it causes your hair to produce more oils. This is untrue- there is no evidence to support the claim that using shampoo stimulates production of sebum on the scalp, including shampoos that contain sulfates and silicons.

Most proponents of no-poo substitute shampoo with an alternative such as ACV or a specially formulated conditioner that effectively serves the same purpose.

# How does shampoo work?

The main active ingredient in shampoo is a type of molecule called a surfacant. This is typically a sulfate, with the most common being Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. You may have heard that all sulfates do is ""create suds"" and damage your hair, this is incorrect.

>*Residues are nonsoluble fats (sebum) that do not dissolve with water. In order to be removed from the hair shaft, surfactants present a hydrophobic molecular portion, and another hydrophilic. The former will chemically bond with the fat, while the latter will bond with the water. The surfactants are generally composed of a chain of fatty hydrocarbons (tail) and a polar head. The polar extremity is capable of giving this portion of the molecule hydrophilic traits that allow it to dissolve in water and wash away the residues.*

What this basically means is that one end of the surfacant will attract water, and the other will repel it and attract sebum, allowing it to be washed out of the hair along with the shampoo.

Surfacants can be classified into four groups: Anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic.

[Here's a classifications chart of common surfacants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/bin/IJT-7-2-g001.jpg)

* **Anionic detergents:** Among the most popular surfactants, they are named for their negatively charged hydrophilic polar group. Derived from fatty alcohols, they are very good at removing sebum from the scalp and hair. However, the excessively cleaned hair is harsh, rough, dull with frizz and prone to tangling. Among them, different classes of detergents are available with certain selective properties.  


1. **Lauryl sulfates:** Popular primary cleansers, they work well in both hard and soft water, produce rich foam, and are easily rinsed. They are excellent cleansers, commonly used in shampoos for oily hair. As the hair becomes harsh and rough, careful selection of a secondary detergent and possible use of a conditioning agent is always required as part of the shampoo formulation. Examples of this class include: Sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and ammonium lauryl sulfate
2. **Laureth sulfates:** These are another class of excellent detergents with good cleansing ability and foaming property which are useful for normal-to-dry hair. Examples of this chemical class are: Sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate
3. **Sarcosines:** They are generally secondary detergents, as they do not remove sebum well from the hair to justify as primary cleansers. They are listed as the second or third on ingredient list of detergents. Excellent conditioners are used in conditioning shampoos and dry hair shampoos. Examples are: Lauryl sarcosine and sodium lauryl sarcosinate
4. **Sulfosuccinates:** These are strong detergents commonly used as a secondary surfactant in oily hair shampoos. Examples are disodium oleaminesulfosuccinate and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.

* **Cationic Detergents:** In contrast to anionic detergents they have a positively charged polar group. They are poor cleansers and do not lather well and are not compatible with anionic detergents, limiting their utility. However, they are excellent at imparting softness and manageability to chemically damaged hair and so are primarily used as daily shampoo for damaged hair such as in case of permanently dyed or chemically bleached hair. Examples are: Long-chain amino esters, ammonioesters, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.
* **Amphoteric Detergents:** Having both positively and negatively charged polar group, they behave differently at lower pH (as cationic detergent) and at higher pH (as anionic detergent). Subgroups include the betaines, sultaines, and imidazolinium derivatives. They are used in baby shampoo and for those with fine and damaged hair because they don’t cause stinging in the eyes in children, foam well and leave hair in manageable state. Examples are: Cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauraminopropionate.
* **Nonionic Detergents:** They have no polar group and are among the mildest of all cleansers and aid to improve the antistatic qualities of a shampoo. They can be combined with ionic detergent as a secondary cleanser. Examples are: Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters and alkanolamides.

All shampoos contain some variation or combination of these substances to wash your hair. Some sulfate-free shampoos may contain none, but this means that they are basically not effectively cleansing your hair. (most sulfate free shampoos will simply use a surfacant that doesn't contain the word ""sulfate"", though)

High end shampoos from salons contain these same ingredients, with the main difference being perhaps nicer smells and a much stronger concentration that requires dilution in water before use.

##### How often should I shampoo?

You probably do not need to shampoo every day, and you do not need to go weeks without shampooing. Shampoo your hair when it is oily or dirty. Experiment with different shampoos and take a look at the active chemicals that are doing the heavy lifting.

# The benefit of conditioner

Modern shampoos are extremely effective. Unfortunately, heavily cleansed hair is not desirable to most, as it is harsh, hard to manage, prone to tangling, and looks dull.

The solution to this is a conditioner, which are sometimes included in the shampoo itself.

A conditioner is any substance which is intended to enhance feel, appearance, fullness, lubricity, shine, and general manageability of hair.

>*Conditioner molecules contain cationic surfactant which gives a positive electric charge to the conditioner. The negative charge of the hair is attracted to the positively charged conditioner molecules, which results in conditioner getting deposited on the hair, especially on areas where there is degree of weathering. This is true for damaged hair as they are even more negatively charged. Thus, conditioners reduce the static electricity. They also flatten the cuticle scales over the hair shaft, reducing the friction between hair fibers, increasing the reflectance of light which improves shine and color. The smooth feel resulting from conditioner use gives easier combing and detangling in both wet and dry conditions. Conditioners temporarily seal split ends and mend trichoptilosis.*

Conditioners will contain a wide variety of ingredients:

* **Cationic surfactants:** Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behentrimonium or propyltrimonium, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine. They are considered the backbone of a conditioner Polymers: Mono and polypeptides like hydrolyzed proteins (amino acids), polypeptides derived from collagen and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
* **Bodying agents and thickeners:** Fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), waxes (e.g. carnauba wax and paraffin wax), or gums (e.g. guar gum) and salt (sodium chloride)
* **Emollients/oily compounds:** These include natural or synthetic oils, but also esters and waxes. Natural oils used in conditioners are, for example, jojoba oil, olive oil, or grape seed oil. The most frequently used synthetic oils are silicone (e.g. dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicone and cyclomethicone) which are even superior to natural oils in terms of film formation, shine and luster. Asian countries have large hair diameters, therefore a higher concentration of silicone is used as compared to that for Caucasian hair (3-5% vs 0.5%)\[1\]
* **Auxiliary emulsifiers:** Ethoxylated fatty alcohols (e.g. polysorbate-80 or ceteareth-20) which are non-ionic agents seem to be particularly effective at providing emulsion stability if it cannot be acheived by catiionic agents alone in a conditioner.

The big bogeyman you may notice is silicons. It is not bad for your hair, and not all silicons are equal. If you use a good shampoo with a good surfacant, build-up is not a concern and you likely don't need to worry too much about this. The backlash against silicons cropped up when people decided to eschew sulfates in their shampoo. Many people quickly realized that without proper cleansing, some silicons would build up in the hair over time.

Like all things related to hair care, the key is balance. A fairly comprehensive resource for different types of silicons and how they behave is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) on [/r/HairCareScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/HairCareScience)\*, keep this in mind when deciding on which hair product to purchase for your hair.

\*while [/r/HairCareScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/HairCareScience) has some good information on it and the moderators know their stuff, be wary of basically every comment from the users, as most of them are simply giving others anecdotal advice and spreading bogeymen.

# How to wash and condition your hair.

The way you apply these products to your hair is undervalued, and doing it properly may have more benefit than you might suspect.

Shampoo should be applied starting from the front and working your way to the back. Applying it directly to the top of the head will create friction and cause tangling.

Once the shampoo has been rinsed from your hair, it's recommended to gently towel dry your hair before applying the conditioner. Conditioner should be applied on the length of the hair, avoiding the scalp.

Leaving conditioner in your hair is not necessary, once the product has been spread over the surface of your hair it has done its job and may be rinsed out completely.

Afterwards the hair may be gently towel dried.

(If your hair is curly, there may be extra steps such as applying a leave-in product while hair is still wet. Using such products on straight thin hair may result in it looking oily and dull.)

# TL;DR?

* Wash your hair when it's dirty/oily.
* There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.
* Sulfates are not bad for your hair, but may cause it to look dry and become hard to manage.
* Use conditioner or use a less effective surfacant to combat the above problem.
* Silicons are not bad for your hair, most good shampoos will prevent any build up from happening.
* The key to good hair care is not going ""no poo"" or ""sulfate/silicon free"", it's finding the right balance of chemicals to wash your hair and keep it looking good.

Coconut oil is a mix of fats extracted from coconuts. There are two major ways to produce coconut oil: wet and dry processes. To obtain coconut oil in the wet process, the white part of the coconut called the “flesh” or “meat” is removed from the outer husk. Following this step, the coconut meat is cold-pressed to create a white semi-transparent coconut milk. The coconut milk is allowed to ferment for a few days which allows the oil to be separated from the milk and recovered. This process of isolating coconut oil in this way is described as “virgin coconut oil”. In other instances, coconut oils are extracted from coconuts using various chemicals or heat. The primary oil present in coconut oil is called lauric acid and typically in quantities ranging from 45-53%.


How is coconut oil used?

Coconuts have been used in many cultures as both a food and medicinal plant for centuries. Today, extracted coconut oils are used as industrial lubricants, fuel for combustion engines, livestock feed, and also as a cooking oil. Other uses include ingestion as a dietary supplement, addition to haircare products, and application to the skin.


Coconut oil and hair

There are a variety of coconut-based cosmetic preparations developed for hair. They include conditioners, shampoos, and oils. Does the addition of coconut oil actually make the hair stronger? Well, one study compared mineral oil, sunflower oil, and coconut oil in the prevention of hair damage. The authors studied protein loss in hair after using the three different oils in pre-wash and post-wash products. After their analysis, they showed that coconut oil helps reduce protein loss^1. However, it is difficult to assess whether this means that it actually strengthens the hair, reduces breakage, and makes hair feel softer. There are many important components to hair strength and texture which include the bonds between the building blocks (amino acids) in hair, natural hair structure, microscopic characteristics, pH balance, and the cleaning detergent composition of the product applied.


Does coconut oil have any antibacterial activity?

Various studies have shown that the major component in coconut oil (lauric acid) has antibacterial activity^2. If is effective against a number of bacteria including those which typically overgrow on the skin and may cause skin ailments. The two most common culprits are the bacteria Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Lauric free fatty acids have also been shown to reduce the growth of the bacteria (P. acnes) which is implicated in acne^3. It is unknown whether this translates into improvement of the human skin since these studies have not been performed. Many factors contribute to the development of acne and overgrowth of P. acnes is just one factor.


Coconut oil and severe dry skin

Similar to haircare products, there are also a variety of skincare products that are coconut based. Many claim to have natural moisturizing factors but are these true? Unfortunately, they have not been shown to definitively improve dry skin when compared to some traditional moisturizers. An excellent high-quality study has been conducted comparing mineral oil to coconut oil^4. It was used for severe dry skin (called xerosis) in a Dermatology clinic located in the Philippines. They had 34 subjects who suffered from severe dry skin on the legs and were instructed to apply the two different oils for 2 weeks and were re-evaluated at the end of this period. In the end, both oils improved the dry skin equally.


Coconut oil and atopic dermatitis (also known as eczema)

Scientists have conducted a similar study as the dry skin reference above, but the study was larger study, and in children 1-13 years of age. All of these children were diagnosed with atopic dermatitis also known as eczema^5. Again, mineral oil was compared to coconut oil after 8 weeks of application. In this case, coconut oil was found to be superior to mineral oil but both moisturizers improved the skin. The coconut oil group achieved moderate improvement in 47% of the patients and excellent in 46%. The mineral oil group achieved moderate improvement in 34% and excellent in 19% of the subjects. They used a standardized evaluation tool for eczema called SCORAD (SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis) to compare the treatments. A special tool that analyzed how well the skin barrier functions (called transepidermal water loss) verified their clinical results. The skin functioned better in the coconut oil group compared to the mineral oil group using this instrument to measure the change.


Coconut oil and psoriasis

Unfortunately, not many studies have investigated the use of coconut oil in psoriasis. There is, however, one small study which has been published specifically looking at this exact topic^6. Coconut oil was applied before phototherapy (narrow-band UVB) and did not show improvement. Their conclusion was that pre-application of coconut oil before phototherapy does not seem to have a benefit.

Coconut oil and seborrheic dermatitis

To date, no studies have been completed using coconut oil for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. There has been one study which evaluated Borage oil in seborrheic dermatitis which is high in gamma-linolenic acid. This molecule has some similarities to lauric acid (the major component found in coconut oil) as they are both fatty acids but they are quite different in overall structure. In this case it was shown to improve infantile seborrheic dermatitis^7.


Coconut oil and the skin

In summary, a variety of high-quality studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of coconut oil on the skin and hair. Coconut oil seems to have some antimicrobial effects, reduces protein loss of the hair, improves atopic dermatitis or eczema, seems to be as good as mineral oil in severe dry skin, but has not been shown yet to improve psoriasis when combined with phototherapy.

Coconut oil and seborrheic dermatitis

To date, no clinical studies have been completed using coconut oil for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis or dandruff. One publication examined the growth of the yeast (Malassezia) in the laboratory setting. In their study, the natural fats present in coconuts allow for the growth of the yeast^1. As you many already know, the overgrowth of this natural body yeast has been implicated as a cause of seborrheic dermatitis. For more information on the causes of seborrheic dermatitis, we encourage you to visit this section of our website.

A clinical study performed in India showed increased growth of Propionibacterium and Malassezia following coconut oil scalp massage^2. They were primarily looking at the scalp microbiome as none of the subjects actually had seborrheic dermatitis so increased flareups was not reported. The skin microbiome is extremely important as different ratios of Malassezia and even an newly discovered species of Malassezia is associated with severe cases of seborrheic dermatitis^3.

There has been one study which evaluated Borage oil in seborrheic dermatitis which is high in gamma-linolenic acid. This molecule has some similarities to lauric acid (the major component found in coconut oil) as they are both fatty acids but they are quite different in overall structure. In this case it was shown to improve infantile seborrheic dermatitis^4.

so,

9669,"Over the years, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the hair care advice I've come across. Things never seem to work the way they're supposed to, and people seem to exclusively rely on anecdotes and personal experiences when giving their recommendations, often repeating things they read in a beauty mag or blog where the main goal is often to sell hair product or push dogma.

So I've done some digging, to learn a little bit about the real chemistry and science behind your hair care products, to dispel some myths and get to the truth of what's going on with your hair.

#What is hair?

>*Hair is an integrated system with a peculiar chemical and physical behavior. It is a complex structure of several morphological components that act as a unit. The hair shaft of mammals is divided into three main regions: Cuticle, cortex and medulla. The medulla is present in corser hair like grey hair, thick hair and beard hair, and it is absent in fine hair of children. There is more medulla in the coarser hair of Asians than Caucasians. The medulla may be involved in the splitting of hairs since it provides an area of weakness as a pathway for the propagation of cracks along the axis of the fiber.*

>*The cuticle is a chemically resistant region and consists of flap overlapping scales (keratinocytes) like shingles on the roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible for the differential friction effect in hair. The cuticle is generally formed by 6–8 scales thick for Asians, slightly less in Caucasians and even less in African hair. A thinner cuticle layer makes African hair more prone to breakage.*

#Why do we shampoo? Is it necessary?

Over time, your hair will develop a build up of dirt and other pollutants (eg: campfire smoke, minerals from hard water) as well as sebum, sweat and dead/peeled skin.

Prior to the 1930's we simply used bar soap to wash our hair. The issue with this is that it would often leave a residue/soap scum on the scalp and hair, which is uncomfortable and aesthetically unpleasing. Shampoo was the answer.

In recent years, you may have heard that you don't need to shampoo, and that it causes your hair to produce more oils. This is untrue- there is no evidence to support the claim that using shampoo stimulates production of sebum on the scalp, including shampoos that contain sulfates and silicons.

Most proponents of no-poo substitute shampoo with an alternative such as ACV or a specially formulated conditioner that effectively serves the same purpose.

#How does shampoo work?

The main active ingredient in shampoo is a type of molecule called a surfacant. This is typically a sulfate, with the most common being Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. You may have heard that all sulfates do is ""create suds"" and damage your hair, this is incorrect.

>*Residues are nonsoluble fats (sebum) that do not dissolve with water. In order to be removed from the hair shaft, surfactants present a hydrophobic molecular portion, and another hydrophilic. The former will chemically bond with the fat, while the latter will bond with the water. The surfactants are generally composed of a chain of fatty hydrocarbons (tail) and a polar head. The polar extremity is capable of giving this portion of the molecule hydrophilic traits that allow it to dissolve in water and wash away the residues.* 

What this basically means is that one end of the surfacant will attract water, and the other will repel it and attract sebum, allowing it to be washed out of the hair along with the shampoo.

Surfacants can be classified into four groups: Anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic.

[Here's a classifications chart of common surfacants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/bin/IJT-7-2-g001.jpg) 

* **Anionic detergents:** Among the most popular surfactants, they are named for their negatively charged hydrophilic polar group. Derived from fatty alcohols, they are very good at removing sebum from the scalp and hair. However, the excessively cleaned hair is harsh, rough, dull with frizz and prone to tangling. Among them, different classes of detergents are available with certain selective properties.
 1. **Lauryl sulfates:** Popular primary cleansers, they work well in both hard and soft water, produce rich foam, and are easily rinsed. They are excellent cleansers, commonly used in shampoos for oily hair. As the hair becomes harsh and rough, careful selection of a secondary detergent and possible use of a conditioning agent is always required as part of the shampoo formulation. Examples of this class include: Sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and ammonium lauryl sulfate
 2. **Laureth sulfates:** These are another class of excellent detergents with good cleansing ability and foaming property which are useful for normal-to-dry hair. Examples of this chemical class are: Sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate
 3. **Sarcosines:** They are generally secondary detergents, as they do not remove sebum well from the hair to justify as primary cleansers. They are listed as the second or third on ingredient list of detergents. Excellent conditioners are used in conditioning shampoos and dry hair shampoos. Examples are: Lauryl sarcosine and sodium lauryl sarcosinate
 4. **Sulfosuccinates:** These are strong detergents commonly used as a secondary surfactant in oily hair shampoos. Examples are disodium oleaminesulfosuccinate and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.

* **Cationic Detergents:** In contrast to anionic detergents they have a positively charged polar group. They are poor cleansers and do not lather well and are not compatible with anionic detergents, limiting their utility. However, they are excellent at imparting softness and manageability to chemically damaged hair and so are primarily used as daily shampoo for damaged hair such as in case of permanently dyed or chemically bleached hair. Examples are: Long-chain amino esters, ammonioesters, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.

* **Amphoteric Detergents:** Having both positively and negatively charged polar group, they behave differently at lower pH (as cationic detergent) and at higher pH (as anionic detergent). Subgroups include the betaines, sultaines, and imidazolinium derivatives. They are used in baby shampoo and for those with fine and damaged hair because they don’t cause stinging in the eyes in children, foam well and leave hair in manageable state. Examples are: Cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauraminopropionate.

* **Nonionic Detergents:** They have no polar group and are among the mildest of all cleansers and aid to improve the antistatic qualities of a shampoo. They can be combined with ionic detergent as a secondary cleanser. Examples are: Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters and alkanolamides.

All shampoos contain some variation or combination of these substances to wash your hair. Some sulfate-free shampoos may contain none, but this means that they are basically not effectively cleansing your hair. (most sulfate free shampoos will simply use a surfacant that doesn't contain the word ""sulfate"", though)

High end shampoos from salons contain these same ingredients, with the main difference being perhaps nicer smells and a much stronger concentration that requires dilution in water before use.

#####How often should I shampoo?

You probably do not need to shampoo every day, and you do not need to go weeks without shampooing. Shampoo your hair when it is oily or dirty. Experiment with different shampoos and take a look at the active chemicals that are doing the heavy lifting. 

#The benefit of conditioner

Modern shampoos are extremely effective. Unfortunately, heavily cleansed hair is not desirable to most, as it is harsh, hard to manage, prone to tangling, and looks dull.

The solution to this is a conditioner, which are sometimes included in the shampoo itself. 

A conditioner is any substance which is intended to enhance feel, appearance, fullness, lubricity, shine, and general manageability of hair. 

>*Conditioner molecules contain cationic surfactant which gives a positive electric charge to the conditioner. The negative charge of the hair is attracted to the positively charged conditioner molecules, which results in conditioner getting deposited on the hair, especially on areas where there is degree of weathering. This is true for damaged hair as they are even more negatively charged. Thus, conditioners reduce the static electricity. They also flatten the cuticle scales over the hair shaft, reducing the friction between hair fibers, increasing the reflectance of light which improves shine and color. The smooth feel resulting from conditioner use gives easier combing and detangling in both wet and dry conditions. Conditioners temporarily seal split ends and mend trichoptilosis.*

Conditioners will contain a wide variety of ingredients:

* **Cationic surfactants:** Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behentrimonium or propyltrimonium, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine. They are considered the backbone of a conditioner
Polymers: Mono and polypeptides like hydrolyzed proteins (amino acids), polypeptides derived from collagen and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)

* **Bodying agents and thickeners:** Fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), waxes (e.g. carnauba wax and paraffin wax), or gums (e.g. guar gum) and salt (sodium chloride)

* **Emollients/oily compounds:** These include natural or synthetic oils, but also esters and waxes. Natural oils used in conditioners are, for example, jojoba oil, olive oil, or grape seed oil. The most frequently used synthetic oils are silicone (e.g. dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicone and cyclomethicone) which are even superior to natural oils in terms of film formation, shine and luster. Asian countries have large hair diameters, therefore a higher concentration of silicone is used as compared to that for Caucasian hair (3-5% vs 0.5%)[1]

* **Auxiliary emulsifiers:** Ethoxylated fatty alcohols (e.g. polysorbate-80 or ceteareth-20) which are non-ionic agents seem to be particularly effective at providing emulsion stability if it cannot be acheived by catiionic agents alone in a conditioner.

The big bogeyman you may notice is silicons. It is not bad for your hair, and not all silicons are equal. If you use a good shampoo with a good surfacant, build-up is not a concern and you likely don't need to worry too much about this. The backlash against silicons cropped up when people decided to eschew sulfates in their shampoo. Many people quickly realized that without proper cleansing, some silicons would build up in the hair over time.

Like all things related to hair care, the key is balance. A fairly comprehensive resource for different types of silicons and how they behave is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) on /r/HairCareScience*, keep this in mind when deciding on which hair product to purchase for your hair.

*while /r/HairCareScience has some good information on it and the moderators know their stuff, be wary of basically every comment from the users, as most of them are simply giving others anecdotal advice and spreading bogeymen.

#How to wash and condition your hair.

The way you apply these products to your hair is undervalued, and doing it properly may have more benefit than you might suspect.

Shampoo should be applied starting from the front and working your way to the back. Applying it directly to the top of the head will create friction and cause tangling. 

Once the shampoo has been rinsed from your hair, it's recommended to gently towel dry your hair before applying the conditioner. Conditioner should be applied on the length of the hair, avoiding the scalp.

Leaving conditioner in your hair is not necessary, once the product has been spread over the surface of your hair it has done its job and may be rinsed out completely.

Afterwards the hair may be gently towel dried. 

(If your hair is curly, there may be extra steps such as applying a leave-in product while hair is still wet. Using such products on straight thin hair may result in it looking oily and dull.)

#TL;DR?

* Wash your hair when it's dirty/oily. 

* There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.

* Sulfates are not bad for your hair, but may cause it to look dry and become hard to manage. 

* Use conditioner or use a less effective surfacant to combat the above problem.

* Silicons are not bad for your hair, most good shampoos will prevent any build up from happening.

* The key to good hair care is not going ""no poo"" or ""sulfate/silicon free"", it's finding the right balance of chemicals to wash your hair and keep it looking good.

Over the years, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the hair care advice I've come across. Things never seem to work the way they're supposed to, and people seem to exclusively rely on anecdotes and personal experiences when giving their recommendations, often repeating things they read in a beauty mag or blog where the main goal is often to sell hair product or push dogma.

So I've done some digging, to learn a little bit about the real chemistry and science behind your hair care products, to dispel some myths and get to the truth of what's going on with your hair.

# What is hair?

>*Hair is an integrated system with a peculiar chemical and physical behavior. It is a complex structure of several morphological components that act as a unit. The hair shaft of mammals is divided into three main regions: Cuticle, cortex and medulla. The medulla is present in corser hair like grey hair, thick hair and beard hair, and it is absent in fine hair of children. There is more medulla in the coarser hair of Asians than Caucasians. The medulla may be involved in the splitting of hairs since it provides an area of weakness as a pathway for the propagation of cracks along the axis of the fiber.*  
*The cuticle is a chemically resistant region and consists of flap overlapping scales (keratinocytes) like shingles on the roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible for the differential friction effect in hair. The cuticle is generally formed by 6–8 scales thick for Asians, slightly less in Caucasians and even less in African hair. A thinner cuticle layer makes African hair more prone to breakage.*

# Why do we shampoo? Is it necessary?

Over time, your hair will develop a build up of dirt and other pollutants (eg: campfire smoke, minerals from hard water) as well as sebum, sweat and dead/peeled skin.

Prior to the 1930's we simply used bar soap to wash our hair. The issue with this is that it would often leave a residue/soap scum on the scalp and hair, which is uncomfortable and aesthetically unpleasing. Shampoo was the answer.

In recent years, you may have heard that you don't need to shampoo, and that it causes your hair to produce more oils. This is untrue- there is no evidence to support the claim that using shampoo stimulates production of sebum on the scalp, including shampoos that contain sulfates and silicons.

Most proponents of no-poo substitute shampoo with an alternative such as ACV or a specially formulated conditioner that effectively serves the same purpose.

# How does shampoo work?

The main active ingredient in shampoo is a type of molecule called a surfacant. This is typically a sulfate, with the most common being Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. You may have heard that all sulfates do is ""create suds"" and damage your hair, this is incorrect.

>*Residues are nonsoluble fats (sebum) that do not dissolve with water. In order to be removed from the hair shaft, surfactants present a hydrophobic molecular portion, and another hydrophilic. The former will chemically bond with the fat, while the latter will bond with the water. The surfactants are generally composed of a chain of fatty hydrocarbons (tail) and a polar head. The polar extremity is capable of giving this portion of the molecule hydrophilic traits that allow it to dissolve in water and wash away the residues.*

What this basically means is that one end of the surfacant will attract water, and the other will repel it and attract sebum, allowing it to be washed out of the hair along with the shampoo.

Surfacants can be classified into four groups: Anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic.

[Here's a classifications chart of common surfacants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/bin/IJT-7-2-g001.jpg)

* **Anionic detergents:** Among the most popular surfactants, they are named for their negatively charged hydrophilic polar group. Derived from fatty alcohols, they are very good at removing sebum from the scalp and hair. However, the excessively cleaned hair is harsh, rough, dull with frizz and prone to tangling. Among them, different classes of detergents are available with certain selective properties.  


1. **Lauryl sulfates:** Popular primary cleansers, they work well in both hard and soft water, produce rich foam, and are easily rinsed. They are excellent cleansers, commonly used in shampoos for oily hair. As the hair becomes harsh and rough, careful selection of a secondary detergent and possible use of a conditioning agent is always required as part of the shampoo formulation. Examples of this class include: Sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and ammonium lauryl sulfate
2. **Laureth sulfates:** These are another class of excellent detergents with good cleansing ability and foaming property which are useful for normal-to-dry hair. Examples of this chemical class are: Sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate
3. **Sarcosines:** They are generally secondary detergents, as they do not remove sebum well from the hair to justify as primary cleansers. They are listed as the second or third on ingredient list of detergents. Excellent conditioners are used in conditioning shampoos and dry hair shampoos. Examples are: Lauryl sarcosine and sodium lauryl sarcosinate
4. **Sulfosuccinates:** These are strong detergents commonly used as a secondary surfactant in oily hair shampoos. Examples are disodium oleaminesulfosuccinate and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.

* **Cationic Detergents:** In contrast to anionic detergents they have a positively charged polar group. They are poor cleansers and do not lather well and are not compatible with anionic detergents, limiting their utility. However, they are excellent at imparting softness and manageability to chemically damaged hair and so are primarily used as daily shampoo for damaged hair such as in case of permanently dyed or chemically bleached hair. Examples are: Long-chain amino esters, ammonioesters, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.
* **Amphoteric Detergents:** Having both positively and negatively charged polar group, they behave differently at lower pH (as cationic detergent) and at higher pH (as anionic detergent). Subgroups include the betaines, sultaines, and imidazolinium derivatives. They are used in baby shampoo and for those with fine and damaged hair because they don’t cause stinging in the eyes in children, foam well and leave hair in manageable state. Examples are: Cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauraminopropionate.
* **Nonionic Detergents:** They have no polar group and are among the mildest of all cleansers and aid to improve the antistatic qualities of a shampoo. They can be combined with ionic detergent as a secondary cleanser. Examples are: Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters and alkanolamides.

All shampoos contain some variation or combination of these substances to wash your hair. Some sulfate-free shampoos may contain none, but this means that they are basically not effectively cleansing your hair. (most sulfate free shampoos will simply use a surfacant that doesn't contain the word ""sulfate"", though)

High end shampoos from salons contain these same ingredients, with the main difference being perhaps nicer smells and a much stronger concentration that requires dilution in water before use.

##### How often should I shampoo?

You probably do not need to shampoo every day, and you do not need to go weeks without shampooing. Shampoo your hair when it is oily or dirty. Experiment with different shampoos and take a look at the active chemicals that are doing the heavy lifting.

# The benefit of conditioner

Modern shampoos are extremely effective. Unfortunately, heavily cleansed hair is not desirable to most, as it is harsh, hard to manage, prone to tangling, and looks dull.

The solution to this is a conditioner, which are sometimes included in the shampoo itself.

A conditioner is any substance which is intended to enhance feel, appearance, fullness, lubricity, shine, and general manageability of hair.

>*Conditioner molecules contain cationic surfactant which gives a positive electric charge to the conditioner. The negative charge of the hair is attracted to the positively charged conditioner molecules, which results in conditioner getting deposited on the hair, especially on areas where there is degree of weathering. This is true for damaged hair as they are even more negatively charged. Thus, conditioners reduce the static electricity. They also flatten the cuticle scales over the hair shaft, reducing the friction between hair fibers, increasing the reflectance of light which improves shine and color. The smooth feel resulting from conditioner use gives easier combing and detangling in both wet and dry conditions. Conditioners temporarily seal split ends and mend trichoptilosis.*

Conditioners will contain a wide variety of ingredients:

* **Cationic surfactants:** Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behentrimonium or propyltrimonium, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine. They are considered the backbone of a conditioner Polymers: Mono and polypeptides like hydrolyzed proteins (amino acids), polypeptides derived from collagen and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
* **Bodying agents and thickeners:** Fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), waxes (e.g. carnauba wax and paraffin wax), or gums (e.g. guar gum) and salt (sodium chloride)
* **Emollients/oily compounds:** These include natural or synthetic oils, but also esters and waxes. Natural oils used in conditioners are, for example, jojoba oil, olive oil, or grape seed oil. The most frequently used synthetic oils are silicone (e.g. dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicone and cyclomethicone) which are even superior to natural oils in terms of film formation, shine and luster. Asian countries have large hair diameters, therefore a higher concentration of silicone is used as compared to that for Caucasian hair (3-5% vs 0.5%)\[1\]
* **Auxiliary emulsifiers:** Ethoxylated fatty alcohols (e.g. polysorbate-80 or ceteareth-20) which are non-ionic agents seem to be particularly effective at providing emulsion stability if it cannot be acheived by catiionic agents alone in a conditioner.

The big bogeyman you may notice is silicons. It is not bad for your hair, and not all silicons are equal. If you use a good shampoo with a good surfacant, build-up is not a concern and you likely don't need to worry too much about this. The backlash against silicons cropped up when people decided to eschew sulfates in their shampoo. Many people quickly realized that without proper cleansing, some silicons would build up in the hair over time.

Like all things related to hair care, the key is balance. A fairly comprehensive resource for different types of silicons and how they behave is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) on [/r/HairCareScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/HairCareScience)\*, keep this in mind when deciding on which hair product to purchase for your hair.

\*while [/r/HairCareScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/HairCareScience) has some good information on it and the moderators know their stuff, be wary of basically every comment from the users, as most of them are simply giving others anecdotal advice and spreading bogeymen.

# How to wash and condition your hair.

The way you apply these products to your hair is undervalued, and doing it properly may have more benefit than you might suspect.

Shampoo should be applied starting from the front and working your way to the back. Applying it directly to the top of the head will create friction and cause tangling.

Once the shampoo has been rinsed from your hair, it's recommended to gently towel dry your hair before applying the conditioner. Conditioner should be applied on the length of the hair, avoiding the scalp.

Leaving conditioner in your hair is not necessary, once the product has been spread over the surface of your hair it has done its job and may be rinsed out completely.

Afterwards the hair may be gently towel dried.

(If your hair is curly, there may be extra steps such as applying a leave-in product while hair is still wet. Using such products on straight thin hair may result in it looking oily and dull.)

# TL;DR?

* Wash your hair when it's dirty/oily.
* There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.
* Sulfates are not bad for your hair, but may cause it to look dry and become hard to manage.
* Use conditioner or use a less effective surfacant to combat the above problem.
* Silicons are not bad for your hair, most good shampoos will prevent any build up from happening.
* The key to good hair care is not going ""no poo"" or ""sulfate/silicon free"", it's finding the right balance of chemicals to wash your hair and keep it looking good.

11202,"Hello, all Haircare Scientists,

The sub keeps growing and growing, which is wonderful!  I figure, since we've gained a lot of people in the past few months, it might be a good time to talk about how we can try and maintain the integrity of our information as much as possible.

If you see comments that you think aren't up to standard with their sourcing, **please report it**!  That means that the mods will get to it much faster, since a reported comment goes into the moderation queue.  We can check them all there, instead of going into every thread multiple times to make sure things look okay.

Be aware of language.  This may seem like a small thing, but in a scientific context, phrasing is important.  Some common things to try and avoid are:

* implying causal relationships where there is none demonstrated or proven.  For example, ""Product X makes my hair fall out"".
* vague clichés that provide little tangible information.  For example, ""Product X works wonders"".
* oversimplifications.  For example, ""You should avoid any products with silicones or other 'bad stuff'""
* excessively prescriptive advice.  For example, ""STOP washing your hair every other day"".
* generalizing a personal experience, without detailed discussion.  For example, ""Product X didn't work for me, so it's terrible.""

Finally, when in any doubt, source.  You may think something common knowledge, but it's always worth taking a look at what the actual scientific literature may have to say on the topic, and you may be surprised.  [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/2ainxh/trying_to_google_for_answers_use_google_scholar/) goes into a little more detail about it.

Above all, remember that personal experience and anecdata are *not* scientific or necessarily factual.  This [brief rundown](http://www.med.nyu.edu/content?ChunkIID=38405) of the various psychological biases that come into play and that can make even scientific studies (if not properly designed) unreliable is interesting and perhaps useful.

What is coconut oil?

Coconut oil is a mix of fats extracted from coconuts. There are two major ways to produce coconut oil: wet and dry processes. To obtain coconut oil in the wet process, the white part of the coconut called the “flesh” or “meat” is removed from the outer husk. Following this step, the coconut meat is cold-pressed to create a white semi-transparent coconut milk. The coconut milk is allowed to ferment for a few days which allows the oil to be separated from the milk and recovered. This process of isolating coconut oil in this way is described as “virgin coconut oil”. In other instances, coconut oils are extracted from coconuts using various chemicals or heat. The primary oil present in coconut oil is called lauric acid and typically in quantities ranging from 45-53%.


How is coconut oil used?

Coconuts have been used in many cultures as both a food and medicinal plant for centuries. Today, extracted coconut oils are used as industrial lubricants, fuel for combustion engines, livestock feed, and also as a cooking oil. Other uses include ingestion as a dietary supplement, addition to haircare products, and application to the skin.


Coconut oil and hair

There are a variety of coconut-based cosmetic preparations developed for hair. They include conditioners, shampoos, and oils. Does the addition of coconut oil actually make the hair stronger? Well, one study compared mineral oil, sunflower oil, and coconut oil in the prevention of hair damage. The authors studied protein loss in hair after using the three different oils in pre-wash and post-wash products. After their analysis, they showed that coconut oil helps reduce protein loss^1. However, it is difficult to assess whether this means that it actually strengthens the hair, reduces breakage, and makes hair feel softer. There are many important components to hair strength and texture which include the bonds between the building blocks (amino acids) in hair, natural hair structure, microscopic characteristics, pH balance, and the cleaning detergent composition of the product applied.


Does coconut oil have any antibacterial activity?

Various studies have shown that the major component in coconut oil (lauric acid) has antibacterial activity^2. If is effective against a number of bacteria including those which typically overgrow on the skin and may cause skin ailments. The two most common culprits are the bacteria Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Lauric free fatty acids have also been shown to reduce the growth of the bacteria (P. acnes) which is implicated in acne^3. It is unknown whether this translates into improvement of the human skin since these studies have not been performed. Many factors contribute to the development of acne and overgrowth of P. acnes is just one factor.


Coconut oil and severe dry skin

Similar to haircare products, there are also a variety of skincare products that are coconut based. Many claim to have natural moisturizing factors but are these true? Unfortunately, they have not been shown to definitively improve dry skin when compared to some traditional moisturizers. An excellent high-quality study has been conducted comparing mineral oil to coconut oil^4. It was used for severe dry skin (called xerosis) in a Dermatology clinic located in the Philippines. They had 34 subjects who suffered from severe dry skin on the legs and were instructed to apply the two different oils for 2 weeks and were re-evaluated at the end of this period. In the end, both oils improved the dry skin equally.


Coconut oil and atopic dermatitis (also known as eczema)

Scientists have conducted a similar study as the dry skin reference above, but the study was larger study, and in children 1-13 years of age. All of these children were diagnosed with atopic dermatitis also known as eczema^5. Again, mineral oil was compared to coconut oil after 8 weeks of application. In this case, coconut oil was found to be superior to mineral oil but both moisturizers improved the skin. The coconut oil group achieved moderate improvement in 47% of the patients and excellent in 46%. The mineral oil group achieved moderate improvement in 34% and excellent in 19% of the subjects. They used a standardized evaluation tool for eczema called SCORAD (SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis) to compare the treatments. A special tool that analyzed how well the skin barrier functions (called transepidermal water loss) verified their clinical results. The skin functioned better in the coconut oil group compared to the mineral oil group using this instrument to measure the change.


Coconut oil and psoriasis

Unfortunately, not many studies have investigated the use of coconut oil in psoriasis. There is, however, one small study which has been published specifically looking at this exact topic^6. Coconut oil was applied before phototherapy (narrow-band UVB) and did not show improvement. Their conclusion was that pre-application of coconut oil before phototherapy does not seem to have a benefit.

Coconut oil and seborrheic dermatitis

To date, no studies have been completed using coconut oil for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. There has been one study which evaluated Borage oil in seborrheic dermatitis which is high in gamma-linolenic acid. This molecule has some similarities to lauric acid (the major component found in coconut oil) as they are both fatty acids but they are quite different in overall structure. In this case it was shown to improve infantile seborrheic dermatitis^7.


Coconut oil and the skin

In summary, a variety of high-quality studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of coconut oil on the skin and hair. Coconut oil seems to have some antimicrobial effects, reduces protein loss of the hair, improves atopic dermatitis or eczema, seems to be as good as mineral oil in severe dry skin, but has not been shown yet to improve psoriasis when combined with phototherapy.

Coconut oil and seborrheic dermatitis

To date, no clinical studies have been completed using coconut oil for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis or dandruff. One publication examined the growth of the yeast (Malassezia) in the laboratory setting. In their study, the natural fats present in coconuts allow for the growth of the yeast^1. As you many already know, the overgrowth of this natural body yeast has been implicated as a cause of seborrheic dermatitis. For more information on the causes of seborrheic dermatitis, we encourage you to visit this section of our website.

A clinical study performed in India showed increased growth of Propionibacterium and Malassezia following coconut oil scalp massage^2. They were primarily looking at the scalp microbiome as none of the subjects actually had seborrheic dermatitis so increased flareups was not reported. The skin microbiome is extremely important as different ratios of Malassezia and even an newly discovered species of Malassezia is associated with severe cases of seborrheic dermatitis^3.

There has been one study which evaluated Borage oil in seborrheic dermatitis which is high in gamma-linolenic acid. This molecule has some similarities to lauric acid (the major component found in coconut oil) as they are both fatty acids but they are quite different in overall structure. In this case it was shown to improve infantile seborrheic dermatitis^4.

I thought I'd found a shampoo that was perfect for my hair finally, but just recently, it hasn't been so great. For the first 2 weeks, all my frizziness was completely gone, but it seems it comes back more and more with each wash, and I've been getting little tiny flakes of either dandruff or product buildup. I always make sure to scrub my scalp with the pads of my fingers and work the lather down, and the conditioner absorbs so well  into my strands that there's barely anything to wash out after waiting a couple minutes. On top of that, my hair has been getting greasy on my second day, which never happened on any shampoo I've ever used (Suave, Tresseme, RegisDesignline, Big & Sexy, Paul Mitchell). I don't use any heat products or any other kinds of products to set my hair, so I don't think that it's because of damage or product buildup, unless it's somehow the shampoo itself. 

I'm really at a loss at this point and not sure if I should try a different line within Shea moisture, to give this one a bit more time, or to try a different brand.
